<!-- No portfolio is complete without a page about your work, so in this assignment, you will create a page where you showcase your design/web projects.

If you don’t have work of your own that you want to include, you can make up “fake” projects. You need to add at least 5 pieces of work on an overview page. When you click on 1 piece, a detail page about it should open.

Use CSS grid to make the overview page responsive. If you want, you can also use flexbox for smaller components such as your navigation.

If you have comments in your code, make sure they are written in English. No other languages are allowed.

Commit and push your updated website to your GitHub repository and submit the URL to your published website here.

After that, show your website to Eveline, Mira, or Lotte at one of the labs during week 6 (the week after the submission deadline). If you don’t present during this week, the next opportunity will be during re-exam week in June. -->
